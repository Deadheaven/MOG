# Real-Time Motion Detection using Background Subtraction (MOG/MOG2)

A Python project for detecting motion in video streams using Gaussian Mixture Models (MOG and MOG2) for background subtraction. The system processes real-time webcam input or video files to identify and highlight moving objects.

---

## üìã Features
- **Real-Time Processing**: Detect motion from live webcam feeds or video files.
- **Background Subtraction**: Uses MOG and MOG2 algorithms for motion detection with dynamic background learning.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust history, threshold, and learning rate to suit various environments.
- **Visual Output**: Displays detected motion regions with bounding boxes or masks.
- **Optional Logging**: Save frames with detected motion for later analysis.

## üíª Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Core Library**: OpenCV  

---

## üîç Use Cases
- Security surveillance systems  
- Monitoring activity in restricted areas  
- Event triggering in home automation systems

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.6+ installed on your system.  
2. Install required Python packages using:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/mog-motion-detection.git

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can tweak the following parameters in the motion_detection.py script:

- history: Number of frames for background modeling (default: 500).
- varThreshold: Threshold for motion segmentation (default: 16).
- learningRate: Learning rate for background updates (default: 0.005).

## üìà Future Enhancements
- Integrating additional tracking algorithms for object tracking.
- Adding support for video recording of detected motion events.
- Real-time notifications via email or SMS.
- Performance optimization for embedded systems (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
