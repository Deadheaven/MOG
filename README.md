# MOG
This project demonstrates a real-time motion detection system using Background Subtraction techniques, specifically the Gaussian Mixture Model (MOG) and its advanced variant, MOG2. Leveraging OpenCV and Python, the system can effectively identify and highlight moving objects in video streams from a webcam or pre-recorded video files.
