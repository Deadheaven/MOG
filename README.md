# Real-Time Motion Detection using Background Subtraction (MOG/MOG2)

A Python project for detecting motion in video streams using Gaussian Mixture Models (MOG and MOG2) for background subtraction. The system processes real-time webcam input or video files to identify and highlight moving objects.

## üìã Features
- **Real-Time Processing**: Detect motion from live webcam feeds or video files.
- **Background Subtraction**: Uses MOG and MOG2 algorithms for motion detection with dynamic background learning.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust history, threshold, and learning rate to suit various environments.
- **Visual Output**: Displays detected motion regions with bounding boxes or masks.
- **Optional Logging**: Save frames with detected motion for later analysis.
